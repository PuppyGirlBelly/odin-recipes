        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Caramelize the onions with about 2 Tbsp of neutral oil under medium low-heat.</li>
            <li>Then fry the garlic in the remaining oil after the onions are caramelized until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the pork and cook until you don't see any pink left on the pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the carton of ramen broth to the broth and raise the heat to high to help it boil.</li>
            <li>As you're waiting for the broth to boil, add any appropriate secret ingredients to the broth.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, bell pepper, and other veggies that you make like to the broth</li>
            <li>Once it boils, lower the heat to a simmer and let it sit covered for 15-20 mintues. Until a knife easily pierces a carrot piece.</li>
            <li>Skim any scum and fat that has accumulated onto the surface with a fine mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat add curry blocks to the broth, and stir until they are fully dissolved and absorbed.</li>
            <li>Simmer once again for 5-10 minutes on medium-low heat to help thicken curry, and stir occasionally to prevent ingredients and roux from burning.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve with rice, noodles, or bread.</li>
        </ol>
